## What Have I Done:
I've made this system information finder program using Python. I've used psutil, platform, GPUtil, tabulate and datetime python module for made this program.

psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python. It is useful mainly for system monitoring, profiling and limiting process resources and management of running processes. It implements many functionalities offered by classic UNIX command line tools such as ps, top, iotop, lsof, netstat, ifconfig, free and others.

The platform module in Python is used to access the underlying platform’s data, such as, hardware, operating system, and interpreter version information. The platform module includes tools to see the platform’s hardware, operating system, and interpreter version information where the program is running.

GPUtil is a Python module for getting the GPU status from NVIDA GPUs using nvidia-smi . GPUtil locates all GPUs on the computer, determines their availablity and returns a ordered list of available GPUs. Availablity is based upon the current memory consumption and load of each GPU.

Tabulate is an open-source python package/module which is used to print tabular data in nicely formatted tables. It is easy to use and contains a variety of formatting functions. It has the following functionalities: One function call for all types of formatting. Can be downloaded in multiple output formats.

Python Datetime module supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals. Date and datetime are an object in Python, so when you manipulate them, you are actually manipulating objects and not string or timestamps.


## Required Packages:
